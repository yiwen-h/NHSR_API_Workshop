## Instructions for creating a codespace with this repository
If you do not have Python on your computer or the ability to install packages, we can use a GitHub codespace instead.

1. First FORK this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Then, to begin using Codespaces go the repo on your own account and click on the big green code button highlighted below:

3. You may need to switch over to the 'Codespaces' tab. Click **create codespace on main**. This will create a virtual machine on GitHub - you don't need to install anything. It can take a few minutes.
4. Your virtual machine with Python is set up! You can start using it. You get 60 hours of run time, plus 15 GB of storage each month, for free.
